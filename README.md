# Turtle-Racing-Game
There are 7 turtles with different colors placed before the Starting Line initially. Every turtle will take a random number of steps to move forward on the race track continuously. On the other end of the race track is the Finish Line. The first one to reach the Finish Line is declared as the winner and the game stops.
